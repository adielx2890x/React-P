          For two months and a week I have been learning web development for the
          frontend part, I have made an effort to learn and get ahead, I have
          had to have self-control and a lot of discipline to get to this point,
          so being told this fragment of my life I present my most recent
          project where I make a pokedex and in case you wonder, YES! that same
          one from pokemon haha, I hope you like it
        </p>

        <p class="aboutP">
          My goal doing this project is to learn more about how to use react and
          its different functionalities. I really hope everything goes well I
          don't want to do that ridiculous dance jsjaj
        </p>
